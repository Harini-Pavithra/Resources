## Kaggle Tips
The following are the interview tips I received as a part of Udacity ND.
1. Try to avoid following datasets and related problems in your resume

- Titanic dataset
- Boston house price dataset
- Iris dataset
- MNIST digits
- Wine quality dataset

The reason is these are for learning and not to include as an important part of your resume. If you are in college, try to find unique datasets or create one doing 
scrapping. Some of the good ideas to generate datasets are

- Face recognition dataset with mask (Available on the different news website)
- Speech datasets generated from videos
- Text datasets from the social media platform
- Tweets/Posts and number of likes/dislike/supports etc.
- Recent Kaggle competitions
- Reviews on Amazon/Google/JustDial

If you are doing an internship, try to push yourself and ask for some internal customer data and offer help in building predictive models. 
Your organization will help you and love your work.
