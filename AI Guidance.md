Questions
1. Do we need knowledge of advance python to begin a career in ML field?
2. What are some best python books according to you ?
3. I could see lots of python and ML related projects in youtube, but from your experience which one you think will the best to start ? For example Attendence system, face recognition system car parking recommendation 
4. If I'm planning for a python developer job what would be the most important topics to cover first ?

Dear Harini,For your first question the answer is yes because the current ML field require you use python for data clean, feature engineer and train, 
select and design model layer. For me because it’s a job and competition required, and I used to hands on with real world project.
so I recommend you start from Kaggle learn https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview where can help you get in quick. 
If I must choose among the three, I will recommend face recognition system car parking recommendation which can be lights your heart. 
The last question is you will have to have projects in this field with ability explain them well and be able pass technical interview for practice python 
I believe practice https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python and https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/ a quiz per day can help you walk through technical interview.
 And this course can help you follow the path to be a web developer and build projects 
in this field https://www.udacity.com/courses/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044 https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/and https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/ for 
step into ML. You can consider Udacity’s full stack Nanodegree program the lecture materials are good!
If you wish to have a book on your hand I recommend select one from the creater of Python https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/266042.Guido_van_Rossum
